--------------------------

There are arrays filled with particles that we can apply rules to. These rules impact the way that the particles interact with eachother based on the force applied to them, which is set when creating a rule. 

The final goal is to have an intricate system of particles with rules that are somewhat realistic to simulate cell-like formations.

Currently, I have particles oscilating around eachother, bouncing off the sides of the screen.

<h2>Rules</h2>
-------------------

A 'Rule' has the following parameters:

1. Particles Force is being applied to
2. Partciles Force is coming from
3. Force, negative for attraction, postive for repulsion.

The 'Rule' method looks as follows
